# Analysis-of-McDonald-s-Consumer-segments
Evaluate if consumer segments exist that have a distinctly different image of McDonald’s.
For this imagine that you are McDonald’s, and you would want to know if consumer segments exist that have a distinctly different image of
McDonald’s. 
Understanding such systematic differences of brand perceptions bymarket segments informs which market segments to focus on, and what messages to
communicate to them. 
We can choose to focus on market segments with a positive perception, and strengthen the positive perception. 
Or we can choose to focus on a market segment that currently perceives McDonald’s in a negative way. 
In this case,we want to understand the key drivers of the negative perception, and modify them.
